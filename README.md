Warzone 2100 AI.

WZ2100 people at
  http://wz2100.net/
has added a javascript API.

I hate JavaScript.  :))
But I'm developing my own AI assist in CoffeeScript.
Looks promising.

The *.js files should be copied into WZ2100 /skirmish/'s AI directory, and
one edit's the rules.js file at the very last line to include player_assits.js.
That's temporary.
Eventualy, I'll develop it to as standard AI files.
