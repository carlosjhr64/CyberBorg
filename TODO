TODO:

Check the commands for errors.  :-??

Dericks/Scouts group should push forward once it's
territory has been secured.


DONE:

2012.02.13

Find a way to estimate costs.
makeTemplate currently returns null if droid is not available to build.
	Using ini files to create the *data* file.
	I'm able to query it for most any information about game objects.

2012.01.30

Convert entirely to OOP.
ai object as a global should only be used in *events*.
	I've fixed all architechtural issues I could find.
	Basically, no real changes to the AI logic itself.

2013.01.25

Looks like there's a meta language emerging.
Try moving commands to cyberborg.script.coffee
	Commands are now written in *script*, but
	in the *command* space.

2013.01.22

Make tracing more efficient.
	From now on, try to test TRACE before calling trace.
	But in any case, trace itself tests TRACE.

2013.01.19

Be able to build the base in any area.
	Just translated the build grid to where we're at.
	Relies on pickStructLocation.
	Could be greatly improved.

Use the standard AI file conventions.

Make color coded trace functions.
	Color coding traces higlights important traces
	above background traces.

2013.01.18

How far can we take the current model until resorting to
regular programming?
	I'm pretty sure command.execute is a catch all.

2013.01.17

What happens when commands.next is nothing?
	Returns Array[length], undefined.
	Stops incrementing.
	In a while loop, exits.

Verify maintance order build when not built,
repairs when built but damage, and
moves to when built and undamaged.
	When I removed reserve from groups, this broke.
	The for_all and for_one functions iterated over groups
	to find its objects.
	The problem with reserve as a group is that it removes
	back to itself, and is not part of the command cycle.
	But then the issue above... :-??
	for_all and for_one now treats reserve as a separate case.
	Hopefully that's enough to hide the issue of weather or not
	reserve is a group.
