Warzone 2100 AI.

WZ2100 people at

have added a javascript API.

I hate JavaScript.  :))
But I'm developing my own AI assist in CoffeeScript.
Looks promising.

Right now I'm actively developing...
It'll play a no base T1 game up to dual machine guns...

I'm developing in the 8 player map, Concrete,
with low power level.
