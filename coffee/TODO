Use the standard AI file conventions.
Be able to build the base in any area.

Dericks/Scouts group should push forward once it's
territory has been secured.


DONE:

2013.01.19

Make color coded trace functions.
	Color coding traces higlights important traces
	above background traces.

2013.01.18

How far can we take the current model until resorting to
regular programming?
	I'm pretty sure command.execute is a catch all.

2013.01.17

What happens when commands.next is nothing?
	Returns Array[length], undefined.
	Stops incrementing.
	In a while loop, exits.

Verify maintance order build when not built,
repairs when built but damage, and
moves to when built and undamaged.
	When I removed reserve from groups, this broke.
	The for_all and for_one functions iterated over groups
	to find its objects.
	The problem with reserve as a group is that it removes
	back to itself, and is not part of the command cycle.
	But then the issue above... :-??
	for_all and for_one now treats reserve as a separate case.
	Hopefully that's enough to hide the issue of weather or not
	reserve is a group.
