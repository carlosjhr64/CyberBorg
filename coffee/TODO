What happens when commands.next is nothing?

DONE:

Verify maintance order build when not built,
repairs when buils but damage, and
moves to when build and undamaged.
	When I removed reserve from groups, this broke.
	The for_all and for_one functions iterated over groups
	to find its objects.
	The problem with reserve as a group is that it removes
	back to itself, and is not part of the command cycle.
	But then the issue above... :-??
	for_all and for_one now treats reserve as a separate case.
	Hopefully that's enough to hide the issue of weather or not
	reserve is a group.
